# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution which can evaluate images and alert the dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## Data Model without Augmentation
- The model is overfitting with high train accuracy and comparitively low validation accuracy

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Data Model with Class imbalance
- The model is not overfitted but train accuracy and validation accuracy is below average

## Data Model with Augmentation
- The model is not overfitted with good train accuracy and validation accuracy.
